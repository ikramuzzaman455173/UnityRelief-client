### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Git installed on your system. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, `cd /path/to/your/folder`.
- Run the following command to clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ikramuzzaman455173/react-typescript-tailwind-redux-starter-template.git
```

This will download the project to your local machine.

### Installing Dependencies

- Change your working directory to the cloned project's directory:

```shell
cd react-typescript-tailwind-redux-starter-template
```

- Use npm to install the project's dependencies, which are typically listed in a `package.json` file:

```shell
npm install
```

### Running the Project

- Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project. The README in the repository should provide information on how to run the project. Common commands are `npm start`, `npm run dev`, or `npm run build`.

For example:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Accessing the Project

- Open a web browser and visit the URL where the project is running. The README should specify the address (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

### Repo Quick Start Command

To quickly clone, install dependencies, open the project in your code editor, and start the development server, you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikramuzzaman455173/react-typescript-tailwind-redux-starter-template.git && cd react-typescript-tailwind-redux-starter-template && npm install && code . && npm run dev
```
